PHYS 281,Extensions in Physics,1–3,"This course covers topics not traditionally taught as part of a normal physics curriculum, but nonetheless useful extensions to the classic pedagogy. Example topics may include estimation, nuclear physics, fluid mechanics, and scaling relationships.",,,,,,,,,,
PHYS 282,Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Biological Systems,4,"The course will introduce basic concepts of dynamical systems, from low dimensional systems to spatially extended systems, including Fisher wave, Turing instability, and excitable systems, and apply them to the study of concrete biological systems taken from a spectrum of fields including ecology and developmental biology. Recommended preparation: basic knowledge of biology and partial differential equations. A first course in partial differential equations; some basic concepts of modern biology.",,,,,,,,,,
